i've def written this down in some notebook somewhere..

the fighting games however should be in the fighting game project repo


harvest moon / stardew valley / earthbound (without the battle system) small-town JRPG love / a 2d animal crossing! that takes place in TW! <3
  - covers 2d top down / JRPG
    - requires tiling, etc.
      - this has been a done a million times, why again?
        - see that one haxe tool for level/map-making..
  - bike around, explore waterfalls, mountain valleys, etc.

** battle game makers:
  - TODO: see my fighting game anarchy repo..

platformer / side-view
  - super smash bros
  - all traditional "2d fighters"

top-down / angled / 2.5d
  - that one game that simon liked
    - hyperlight drifter!
  - that 3v1 game.. crawl?
    - tight, fast, funky
  - ragnarok online
    - not so much for the battle system, but for how incredible 2d can look!
      - though, the battle system was fine too, lol... just an impossible grind by default
  - fat princess
  - final fantasy tactics?
    - this one was beautiful for a 2d game.. full of seasons, geography, characters..

super mario rpg
  - how was this not 3d..?


3d
  - fez
  - that one samurai game
    - didn't have to be 3d.. just one-hit, tight
